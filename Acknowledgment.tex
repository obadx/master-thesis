I express my greatest gratitude to my mother, Azza, for her unwavering support from the beginning---financially, emotionally, and by providing a quiet space in which to work. I can never fully repay her contributions.

We also express our profound gratitude to several individuals and organizations: Sheikh Ahmed Abdelsalam, Sheikh Mustafa Fathy, and Sheikh Mohamed Rabeea for their invaluable guidance in understanding and representing Tajweed rules and common learner mistakes. We extend our thanks to BA-HPC\footnote{\url{https://hpc.bibalex.org/}} for providing access to high-performance computing resources, which greatly facilitated our data processing. Special appreciation goes to Engineer Khaled Bahaa for his assistance with arranging payment methods for GPU resources.
